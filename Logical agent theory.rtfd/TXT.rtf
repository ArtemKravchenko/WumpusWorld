\f0\fs24 \cf0 Knowledge base - the central component of a knowledge-based agents.\
The Knowledge base is set of sentences.\
Each sentence is expressed in a language called a knowledge representation language.\
Axiom - the seance is taken as given without being derived from other sentences.\
Inference - deriving new sentences from old. (TELL and ASK).\
Background Knowledge - initial Knowledge Base.\
Syntax - specifies all sentences that are well formed.\
Semantic defines the truth of each sentence with respect to each possible world.\
Model - possible world\
The model "m" satisfies sentence "alfa" - "m" is model of "alfa"\
Entailment - the idea that a sentence follows logically from another sentence: alfa |= beta. It means that in every model where alfa is true, beta is also true.\
Logical inference - conclusion derived by applying entailments.\
Inference algorithm is complete if it can derive any sentence that is entailed.\
Two sentences are logically equivalent if they are true in the same set of models.\
The sentence is valid if it is true in all models.\
The valid sentences are also known as tautologies.\
The sentence is satisfiable if it is true in, or satisfied by, some model. (Satisfiability can be checked by enumerating the possible models until one is found that satisfies the sentence) \
SAT - is is the problem of determining the satiability of sentences in propositional logic.\
Proofs - the chain of conclusions that lead the rules to desired goal.\
The units resolution rule tale a clause - a dissection of literals.\
The sentence expressed as a conjunction of clauses is said to be in conductive normal form or CNF.{{\NeXTGraphic –°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2013-09-17 –≤ 17.56.54.png \width14320 \height5700

Fluent - aspect of the world that changes.\
Atemporal variables - symbols associated with permanent aspects of the world do not need a time superscript and are sometimes called.\
Example of effect axiom that specify the outcome of an action at the next time step:\

Frame axioms explicity asserting all the propositions that remain the same. For example:\
